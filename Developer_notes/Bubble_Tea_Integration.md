Integrating the Bubble Tea UI library into your existing Go application can vary in complexity depending on how deeply you want to integrate it and how interactive you want your UI to be. Here's a general idea of what the process might involve:

Assessing the Scope of Integration: You need to decide if Bubble Tea will be a part of certain aspects of your application or if it will be the primary method of interaction throughout. If it's the latter, more extensive refactoring may be necessary.

Updating the main Function: The main function will need significant changes as Bubble Tea operates on a model-update-view pattern, which is quite different from the standard procedural approach in typical Go applications. You'll need to define a model to represent your application's state, specify how updates to this state are handled, and determine how the state is rendered.

Refactoring Other Functions: Depending on your application's structure, you might need to refactor other functions to fit into Bubble Tea's model-update-view architecture. This could involve changing how you handle user input, process data, and render outputs.

Incremental Integration: It's often practical to integrate a new UI framework incrementally. Start by identifying a section of your application that can be isolated (like a specific menu or feature). Convert this section to use Bubble Tea and then gradually expand to other parts of the application.

Function-by-Function Conversion: Theoretically, you could provide the code function by function for conversion. However, this approach might be challenging due to the interconnected nature of most applications. A change in one part (to accommodate a TUI framework like Bubble Tea) often necessitates changes in other parts.

Compatibility Considerations: Ensure that the functions you modify or write anew are compatible with the overall architecture and data flow of your Bubble Tea application.

Regarding the assistance in converting each function: while I can provide guidance and suggestions on how to refactor specific functions or sections of your code to work with Bubble Tea, rewriting the entire application function by function might be beyond the scope of this platform. It would be more practical to provide you with guidelines, best practices, and examples that you can apply to refactor your code.

If you decide to proceed with Bubble Tea, you might start with a small, isolated part of your application, and once you're comfortable with the library, gradually expand its use throughout your project.
