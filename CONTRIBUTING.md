## Dev Note:

Developers are encouraged to this project, you can message me on GH if you have an idea 
Or fork the repo, make the changes, and i will add and review them via a pull request :)
thanks. 

## For releases:

All submissions MUST have the binary, binary signature, and the hash of this binary. 
Source code must also be submitted as default. 
This allows users to compile for themselves and verify the integrity of the package. 
(Latest versions can be different compared to main therefor for verification, only download the latest release and verify source by building yourself.) 
(Do not clone main unless modifying / contributing / users download from releases)
