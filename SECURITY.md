## Summary of version suport.
***Pretty much everything previous of the most recent security update.***
When a new security update labled '"VERSION" Security update' everything before that update would not be supported or actively worked on / modified. 


## Reporting a Vulnerability

> We take security vulnerabilities extreamly seriousy and you can expect a prompt fix, resolution, and documentation letter. 

Steps, disregard if unavailable: 

1. Either message me in the Discord if you have me directly.
2. Add me / find me via my ENS *(satunix.eth)* 
3. Or submit an issue into the main public repository as a bug report with the title "SECURITY VULNERABILITY"

This would be fixed immediately in the next update.
