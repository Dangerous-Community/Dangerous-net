# Keycard implementation 

Note the URL: 

Most promising and recomended: **The Official Go API**
> [Keycard for Go applications](https://github.com/status-im/keycard-go/)
Could use APDU, whatever tf that means. 
> [ Keycard APDU API ](https://keycard.tech/docs/apdu/)https://keycard.tech/docs/apdu/
Or we could use the WEB3 Application and push it through a localhost web UI (One of my favs for the future)
> [Localhost web3 application](https://keycard.tech/docs/web3.html)https://keycard.tech/docs/web3.html
