# Keycard Implementation

## Introduction

This document outlines the process of integrating Keycard into a Java-based application for symmetrically encrypting and decrypting data, particularly focusing on file-based applications with IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) storage.

## Developers: Criteria for Commits

Contributors should follow these guidelines to ensure consistency and security in the codebase.

### Encryption Process:

#### User Passphrase Input:
- Ensure secure input handling.
- Use secure GUI prompts or console inputs that don't echo the passphrase.

#### Signing Passphrase with Keycard:
- Keycards typically sign a hash of data rather than the passphrase directly.
- Use the Keycard to securely generate or sign a hash of the passphrase for encryption.

#### Key Generation and Management:
- Generate a symmetric key based on the signed data, ensuring cryptographic security.
- Securely handle the key in memory and clear it immediately after use.

#### Integration with GPG:
- Pass the symmetric key to GPG securely for encryption.
- Avoid using command-line arguments for key passing.

#### Security Measures:
- Implement measures to prevent memory dumping.
- Ensure secure deletion of temporary files or logs containing sensitive data.
- Use secure file handling libraries in Java.

#### Uploading to IPFS:
- Maintain the integrity and confidentiality of data during the IPFS upload process.
- Securely handle IPFS interactions and manage CIDs appropriately.

### Decryption Process:

#### Retrieve File from IPFS:
- Ensure secure retrieval of the encrypted file from IPFS using the CID.

#### Passphrase Handling:
- Manage passphrase input securely, similar to the encryption process.

#### Keycard Interaction:
- Use the Keycard to generate or retrieve the decryption key securely.

#### Decrypting with GPG:
- Decrypt the file using GPG with the symmetric key derived from the Keycard-signed data.
- Ensure secure handling of key material during decryption.

#### Post-Decryption Security:
- Manage decrypted data securely.
- Clean up any sensitive remnants in memory or temporary storage.

#### Error Handling and Logging:
- Implement robust error handling for Keycard interactions, GPG operations, and IPFS retrieval.
- Avoid storing sensitive information in logs.

### General Considerations:

#### Cryptographic Best Practices:
- Adhere to best practices for key generation, data signing, and symmetric encryption.

#### Code Security:
- Ensure the Java code handling cryptographic operations is secure against common vulnerabilities.

#### User Feedback:
- Provide clear and user-friendly feedback for operations, especially for errors or successful operations.

#### Documentation and Testing:
- Document the process clearly, including prerequisites and configurations.
- Thoroughly test the application for reliability and security.

## Understanding Keycard Capabilities

### Key Storage:
- Keycard is designed for secure storage of private keys, commonly used in digital signatures and transaction authentication.

### Signing Operations:
- Keycard can sign data blocks using stored private keys, adaptable for file-based applications and IPFS storage.

### Encryption/Decryption:
- While not a primary function, Keycard's signing capabilities can be adapted for encryption/decryption processes in file-based applications.

## Implementation Notes

### Data Flow for Encryption and Decryption Using Java Keycard

#### Encryption:
- User enters a passphrase.
- Sign the passphrase with the Keycard.
- Generate a unique key based on the signed passphrase.
- Use the key as string data for GPG encryption.
- Remove sensitive process logs or files to prevent data exposure.
- Encrypt the data with GPG and pass the encrypted file to IPFS.

#### Decryption:
- Retrieve the file from IPFS using its CID.
- User re-enters the passphrase.
- Sign the passphrase with the Keycard to regenerate the decryption key.
- Use the key to decrypt the file with GPG.
- Ensure removal of sensitive logs or temporary files.
