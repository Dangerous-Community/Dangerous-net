# Keycard implementation 

Note the URL: 

Most promising and recomended: **The Official Go API**

- [Keycard for Go applications](https://github.com/status-im/keycard-go/)

WOuld be the easiest to implement, just have to make sure your can encrypt and decrypt files using the keycard CLI. 

- [Keycard for CLI (can pass sysargs with Go to keycard CLI)](https://github.com/status-im/keycard-cli)

Could use APDU, whatever tf that means. 

- [ Keycard APDU API ](https://keycard.tech/docs/apdu/)https://keycard.tech/docs/apdu/

Or we could use the WEB3 Application and push it through a localhost web UI (One of my favs for the future)

- [Localhost web3 application](https://keycard.tech/docs/web3.html)https://keycard.tech/docs/web3.html
