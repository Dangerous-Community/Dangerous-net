To structure your project with main.go and the two libraries keycard_link.go and ipfs_link.go, here is a high-level overview of each program and their functionalities:

1. main.go (Located at /src/main.go)
The main.go file will serve as the entry point of the application. It will handle user inputs, coordinate the encryption/decryption processes, and manage the flow between Keycard operations and IPFS interactions.

High-Level Overview:
Import Libraries: Import keycard_link and ipfs_link libraries, along with other necessary Go packages.
Command-Line Interface (CLI): Implement CLI parsing for user inputs (like file paths, commands for encrypt, decrypt, upload, download, etc.).
Coordinate Operations: Depending on the user's input, call appropriate functions from the keycard_link and ipfs_link libraries to perform encryption, decryption, upload to IPFS, and download from IPFS.
Error Handling: Robust error handling for user inputs, file operations, and library function calls.
User Feedback: Provide feedback to the user about the status of operations, errors, or successful completions.
2. keycard_link.go (Located at /src/libb/keycard_link.go)
This library will handle all interactions with the Keycard, including signing operations, key management, and passphrase handling.

High-Level Overview:
Keycard Integration: Functions to communicate with the Keycard for signing and key management.
Sign Data: Function to sign data (or passphrase hash) using the Keycard.
Generate/Retrieve Keys: Functions to generate new keys or retrieve existing keys from the Keycard.
Handle Passphrase: Securely handle passphrase input for Keycard operations.
Error Management: Handle errors specific to Keycard operations and provide meaningful error messages.
3. ipfs_link.go (Located at /src/libb/ipfs_link.go)
This library will manage interactions with IPFS, including uploading encrypted files and retrieving them.

High-Level Overview:
IPFS Client Setup: Initialize and configure the IPFS client.
Upload to IPFS: Function to upload encrypted files to IPFS and return the CID.
Download from IPFS: Function to download files from IPFS using the provided CID.
Handle IPFS Errors: Robust error handling for IPFS operations.
Data Integrity Check: Optionally, implement functionality to verify the integrity of downloaded files.
General Development Approach:
Modularity: Keep the code modular by clearly separating Keycard-related functions and IPFS-related functions in their respective libraries.
Testing: Write unit tests for both libraries to ensure that each function behaves as expected.
Documentation: Document each function in the libraries, explaining its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any side effects.
Security: Pay special attention to security, especially in handling cryptographic materials and sensitive user inputs.
By structuring your application this way, you maintain a clean separation of concerns, where main.go acts as the orchestrator, and the two libraries handle specific functionalities, making the codebase easier to maintain and scale.
